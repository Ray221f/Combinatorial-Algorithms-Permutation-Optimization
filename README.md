## 📘 Overview
This repository contains our solutions for **Assignment 1** of the *Combinatorial Algorithms (104291)* course, Spring 2025.  
The assignment consists of two main programming exercises implemented in **Python**:

1. **Exercise 1:** Detecting *Induced Paw Subgraphs* in an undirected graph.  
2. **Exercise 2:** Computing the **Trotter–Johnson rank** of a valid topological permutation under given precedence constraints.

All source files are structured, documented, and can be executed in a Unix-based environment using Python 3.

## 🧩 Exercise 1 — Induced Paw Detection

### Description
A **paw graph** is a 4-vertex graph consisting of a triangle plus one additional vertex connected to exactly one vertex of the triangle.  

This program reads an undirected graph from standard input and outputs all **sets of 4 vertices** that form an **induced paw subgraph**, listed in **lexicographic order**.  
If no paw exists, it reports accordingly.

### Input Format


ISSUES TO BE FIXED:

1. Assignment 1, Exercise 1, issue 1:
   Check if "continue" is allowed to be use!
2. Assignment 1, Exercise 2, issue 1:
   Both of ds_comb_ass_1-2.py and gpt_comb_ass_1-2.py have issues with printing the output after reading all the inputs. Fix it!!!
