## 📘 Overview
This repository contains our solutions for **Assignment 1** of the *Combinatorial Algorithms (104291)* course, Spring 2025.  
The assignment consists of two main programming exercises implemented in **Python**:

1. **Exercise 1:** Detecting *Induced Paw Subgraphs* in an undirected graph.  
2. **Exercise 2:** Computing the **Trotter–Johnson rank** of a valid topological permutation under given precedence constraints.

All source files are structured, documented, and can be executed in a Unix-based environment using Python 3.

## 🧩 Exercise 1 — Induced Paw Detection

### Description
A **paw graph** is a 4-vertex graph consisting of a triangle plus one additional vertex connected to exactly one vertex of the triangle.  

This program reads an undirected graph from standard input and outputs all **sets of 4 vertices** that form an **induced paw subgraph**, listed in **lexicographic order**.  
If no paw exists, it reports accordingly.

### Input Format
n m
v1 w1
v2 w2
...
vm wm
- `n`: number of vertices  
- `m`: number of edges  
- `vi wi`: edges between vertices (0-indexed)

### Output
- A list of vertex sets (each set as a list) forming induced paws, in lexicographic order.  
- If none found, prints: It found no paws in the graph.

### Example 1 (from assignment)
**Input**
7 10
1 2
1 3
2 3
3 4
2 4
0 1
0 4
6 4
5 3
2 6
**Output**
[0,1,2,3]
[0,2,3,4]
[0,2,4,6]
[1,2,3,5]
[1,2,3,6]
[1,2,4,6]
[2,3,4,5]

### Example 2 (no paws)
**Input**
6 12
0 1
0 3
1 3
2 1
2 4
4 1
5 3
5 4
3 4
0 2
0 5
2 5
**Output**
It found no paws in the graph.
### How It Works
1. Builds an **adjacency list** of the graph.  
2. Iterates over all **4-combinations of vertices** (without using `itertools`).  
3. For each combination:
   - Counts total edges between these 4 vertices.
   - Checks if they form a triangle + one pendant vertex.
4. Prints results in lexicographic order (generated by nested loops, not `sort()`).

## 🔁 Exercise 2 — Topological Sorting & Trotter–Johnson Rank

### Description
Given a set of **precedence constraints** \( a \prec b \) between numbers \(1 \dots n\),  
the program finds a **permutation** satisfying all constraints (if possible)  
and computes its **Trotter–Johnson rank**.

If no permutation satisfies the constraints (graph contains a cycle),  
the program prints a message indicating impossibility.

### Input Format
n m
a1 b1
a2 b2
...
am bm
- `n`: number of elements  
- `m`: number of constraints  
- `ai bi`: means "a must come before b"

### Output
- The valid **topological order** (if exists).  
- Its **Trotter–Johnson rank**.  
- Otherwise: Impossible to satisfy the conditions

### Example 1 (from assignment)
**Input**
10 8
2 3
4 5
1 2
1 4
2 4
7 8
4 7
3 6
**Output (example)**
Topological Sort: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Trotter–Johnson Rank: 244529

### Example 2 (impossible case)
**Input**
5 5
1 2
2 3
5 3
3 4
4 1
**Output**
Impossible to satisfy the conditions
### How It Works
1. Builds a **directed graph** from the constraints using adjacency lists.  
2. Performs **Depth-First Search (DFS)** topological sorting with **cycle detection**.  
3. If acyclic:
   - Computes **Trotter–Johnson rank** recursively based on position of the largest element.
4. Outputs the result.

## 🧠 Algorithmic Highlights

| Concept | Algorithm Used | Complexity |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Induced Paw Detection | Brute-force enumeration of 4-subsets + structural checks | \(O(n^4)\) |
| Topological Sort | DFS with cycle detection | \(O(n+m)\) |
| Rank Calculation | Recursive Trotter–Johnson algorithm | \(O(n^2)\) |

Both programs are efficient enough to handle all test cases (including 10-vertex graphs) within the required time limit (< 1 minute).
